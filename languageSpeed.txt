Fastest Languages (Low-Level, Compiled)

These languages are closest to machine code, offering maximum performance with fine control over memory.

Assembly – Directly translates to machine code, the fastest possible execution.
C – Lightweight, compiled, and allows manual memory management.
Rust – Memory safety without a garbage collector; compiled to efficient machine code.
C++ – Similar to C but with added features like object-oriented programming.
Zig – A modern, fast alternative to C with safety features.

Mid-Speed Languages (Optimized Compiled & JIT-Compiled)
These languages are compiled but may include runtime optimizations, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, or garbage collection, which can slightly impact speed.

Go – Compiled, with fast execution and a lightweight garbage collector.
Swift – Highly optimized for Apple hardware, compiled but includes safety features.
Java – Uses a JIT compiler, so it's slower than pure compiled languages but optimized for performance.
Kotlin – Runs on the JVM like Java, with similar speed.
D – Compiled like C++ but with garbage collection.

Slower Languages (Interpreted & High-Level)
These languages prioritize ease of development over execution speed and often use interpreters or bytecode.

C# – JIT-compiled on .NET runtime; faster than most interpreted languages.
Julia – JIT-compiled, optimized for scientific computing.
JavaScript (Node.js) – JIT-compiled, optimized for web applications.
Python – Interpreted with dynamic typing, making it slower than compiled languages.
Ruby – Similar to Python but typically slower due to less optimization.
PHP – Interpreted, slower than JavaScript and Python in most cases.

Slowest Languages (Fully Interpreted & Scripting)
These languages prioritize flexibility and ease of use over raw performance.

Perl – Powerful for text processing but slower than Python.
Lua – Used in game scripting, faster than Python but still interpreted.
Bash (Shell Scripting) – Mainly used for automation, not built for speed.
R – Optimized for statistical computing, but slow due to dynamic typing and interpretation.
